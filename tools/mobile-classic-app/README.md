# Curvios Clash Classic Mobile

Capacitor wrapper for the phone-first Classic-only game build. It is separated
from the Map Tools Android wrapper so both apps can keep their own native
project and web bundle.

Build the web bundle from the repository root:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:build
```

Create the Android project once:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:add
```

After that, sync or open the native project:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:sync
npm run app:classic:android:open
```

Refresh and check that the Android public assets match the latest
`dist/mobile-classic` bundle:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:assets:check
```

Build and install a debug APK on the connected Android device:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:install
```

Update the connected phone from the configured GitHub remote:

```bash
npm run app:classic:android:update:github
```

The updater accepts `--remote <name>` and `--branch <name>`. It only fast-forwards
from a GitHub remote and refuses to pull when the working tree has uncommitted
changes, then rebuilds, installs, and launches `de.curviosclash.classic`.

The native project lives in `android-classic`; the shipped web bundle is
`dist/mobile-classic`. The app icon source is `tools/mobile-classic-app/assets/icon-source.png`.
The mobile menu also reads `mobile-classic.manifest.json` and offers a compact
GitHub release check. Set `CURVIOS_CLASSIC_APP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` when building
from a fork.
